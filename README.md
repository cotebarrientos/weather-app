# Weather App

**Weather-App** is my second project using react, and this App is able to give the weather forecast up to a week, and it is updated every hour thanks to the information provided by the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/). 

This project is part of the exercises performed in my specialization course about React JS and Redux on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-js-redux-es6-completo-de-0-a-experto-espanol/).

## Deployment

### Clone Project from GitHub

**1.** Follow this link to the [Project GitHub repository](https://github.com/cotebarrientos/weather-app).

**2.** Scroll to the top of this repository and click on the "clone or download button".

**3.** Decide whether you want to clone the project using HTTPS or an SSH key and do the following:
- HTTPS: click on the checklist icon to the right of the URL.
- SSH key: first click on 'Use SSH' then click on the same icon as above.

**4.** Open the 'Terminal'.

**5.** Choose the location for the cloned directory.

**6.** Type `git clone`, and then paste the clone URL.
- `git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/REPOSITORY`

**7.** Press 'Enter' to create your local clone.

### Local Deployment

For local deployment you must have an IDE, like for example **VS Code**

**1.** After cloning this project, navigate to the correct file location after unpacking the files.
- `cd <path to folder>`

**2.** Then run the following command in the terminal, in order to run this project locally.
- `npm start`

**3.** After that, this React project should be running on `http://localhost:3000/`

## Available Scripts

**1.** In the project directory, you can run: `npm start`. Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

**2.** `npm test`: Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

**3.** `npm run build`: Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

**4.** `npm run storybook`: In order to run Storybook and check the components.

## Credits
### Code
Part of coding written for this project was based on the source code provided by [weather-app-2020](https://github.com/correooke/weather-app-2020), which is part of the specialization course called [React JS + Redux + ES6. Completo ¡De 0 a experto! (español)](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-js-redux-es6-completo-de-0-a-experto-espanol/).  
### Acknowledgements
I would like to thank the following people who encouraged me to continue specializing in the IT area.
